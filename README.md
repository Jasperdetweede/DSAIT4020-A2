# DSAIT4020 Assignment 2

## Running the Code
The file "main.py" is the final implementation of our code.

"requirements.txt" contains all library requirements for our code to run

There should also be a set of folders, "unprocessed_data" and "raw_data". The second one is not needed if the first one exists. In case the whole pipeline is needed to be checked from completely raw data the first folder can be deleted and it will be regenerated from the data in the first one.

In the function "run_everything()" lines can be commented out to choose to only run the code for a subset of our datasets.
